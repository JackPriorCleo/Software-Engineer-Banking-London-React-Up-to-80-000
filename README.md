# Software Engineer // Banking // London // React // Up to £80,000

A Tier 1 bank is on the look-out for software engineers to join the team as part of their digital revolution!

Sitting in their main technology hub, you would be working on their global platforms reaching around ~40 million active customers, making a positive change and difference to their every day banking. They're looking for engineers to work across either a front-end of full-stack role, working on their main technologies of React and Redux, a Java back-end, and looking to bring in Node microservices in the near future. As a team, they work to both a TDD environment and in an Agile methodology.

The projects involve building upon both their web and mobile applications, everything from improving customer journeys, how a customer opens an account, or working on innovative products to improve customer relations. An ideal candidate would be someone who can bring new ideas to the table, investigate new technologies and help the team consistently innovate.

They allow flexible working, both in terms of working hours and working from home.
